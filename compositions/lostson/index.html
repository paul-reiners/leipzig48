<div id="Content">
<p>This piece was inspired by Theodore Roethke's poem "The Lost
Son".</p>

<p>
I wrote it after reading an article in <i>The New Yorker</i>
about Roethke. Here is the relevant passage from the article:
</p>

<blockquote>From &ldquo;The Lost Son and Other
Poems&rdquo; through his next book, &ldquo;Praise to the
End!&rdquo; (1951), to &ldquo;The Waking&rdquo; (1953),
Roethke experimented with this new style. But he never accomplished
more with it than he did in &ldquo;The Lost Son,&rdquo; the
first poem in the sequence. Like &ldquo;The Waste Land,&rdquo;
whose influence is profound but seldom obvious, &ldquo;The Lost
Son&rdquo; dispenses with plot and argument for the sake of a
hypnotically effective voice. The poem charts the emotions of a man
mourning the death of his father, and it progresses through a chain of
moods: grief, nostalgia, regression to childhood terrors, and, finally,
a tentative reawakening to adulthood. Appropriately, Roethke draws from
the deepest wells of the English language&mdash;Mother Goose,
Shakespeare, the Bible&mdash;in order to create a new idiom for
primal experience: <br />

  <blockquote>
    <p>All
the leaves stuck out their tongues; <br />

I shook the softening chalk of my
bones, <br />

Saying, <br />

Snail, snail, glister me forward, <br />

Bird, soft-sigh me home, <br />

Worm, be with me. <br />

This is my hard time. </p>

  </blockquote>
