<h1>The Beale Papers</h1>

<h2>TREASURE BURIED in 1819 and 1821,  </h2>

<h2>near Bufords, in Bedford County, Virginia,</h2>

<h2>and Which Has Never Been Recovered.  </h2>

<p>all(81) men(82) are(83) endowed(89) by(90) their(91) creator(92) <br />
with(93) certain(94) unalienable(95) rights(96) <br />
among(98) these(99) are(100) life(101) liberty(102) and(103) <br />
the(104) pursuit(105) of(106) happiness(107)  </p>

<p>He toiled faithfully at his work; <br />
A charm attended it, <br />
The delight he experienced <br />
When accident revealed to him <br />
The explanation of the paper marked "2."   </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have deposited in the county of Bedford, <br />
  about four miles from Buford's, in an excavation or vault, <br />
  six feet below the surface of the ground, the following articles: <br />
  one thousand and fourteen pounds of gold, and <br />
  three thousand eight hundred and twelve pounds of silver <br />
  nineteen hundred and seven pounds of gold, and <br />
  twelve hundred and eighty-eight pounds of silver  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This accident, <br />
Affording so much pleasure at the time, <br />
Was a most unfortunate one for him, <br />
It induced him to neglect family, friends, <br />
And all legitimate pursuits for what has proved, so far, <br />
The veriest illusion.  </p>

<p>The writer lost all hope of ultimate success, <br />
Reduced from comparative affluence to absolute penury, <br />
Entailing suffering upon those it was my duty to protect <br />
My eyes were at last opened to their condition, <br />
I resolved to sever at once, and forever, <br />
All connection with the affair, <br />
And retrieve, if possible, my errors, <br />
And retrieve, if possible, my errors,  </p>

<p>life(101) liberty(102) and(103) <br />
the(104) pursuit(105) of(106) happiness(107) <br />
